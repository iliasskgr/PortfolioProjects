# Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository
During my engineering studies, I honed my coding skills in C, Java, Assembly, Verilog, SQL, Python, and R, gaining extensive knowledge in programming. Following my business studies, I found my calling in Data Analytics and Data Science, aiming to foster data-driven decision-making. This repository serves as a haven for all code and queries stemming from the Portfolio Projects I undertake. It will house not only my university projects but also new endeavors completed in my spare time. The primary tools utilized in these projects include Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python. With monthly updates in the pipeline, stay tuned for more!
